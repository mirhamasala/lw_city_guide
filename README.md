# Wagon City Guides

When I finished my coding bootcamp with [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), my teacher suggested that I create a city guide for Le Wagon Bali to keep practicing my coding skills. One freelance project and another front-end job later, I finally got to it.

I made Wagon City Guides for the community of Le Wagon who study and teach in 39 countries.

With Wagon City Guides we now have an app on which we can share and find recommendations for all the cities of Le Wagon's campuses.

Wagon City Guides is also part of my "web dev MBA." You can find out more about that here: [Leap of Code - The Curriculum](https://www.mirhamasala.com/leap-of-code/#curriculum)

## Disclaimer

[Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) is an intensive 9-week coding bootcamp.

Wagon City Guides is not endorsed by Le Wagon. It's an independent project by Laura Crompton and Mirha Masala.
