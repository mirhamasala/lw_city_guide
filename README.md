# Wagon City Guides

Wagon City Guides is a travel guide by and for the community of Le Wagon who study and teach in 38 countries.

I created this app so that we have a place where we can share and find recommendations for all the cities of Le Wagon's campuses.

This project is also part of my "web dev MBA." You can find out more about that here: [Leap of Code - The Curriculum](https://www.mirhamasala.com/leap-of-code/#curriculum)

## Disclaimer

[Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) is an intensive 9-week coding boot camp.

Wagon City Guides is not endorsed by Le Wagon. It's an independent project by Laura Crompton and Mirha Masala.
